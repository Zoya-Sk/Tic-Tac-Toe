- **JavaScript**: To handle the game logic and interactivity.

## How It Works

1. Players take turns clicking the grid boxes to place their markers (`X` and `O`).
2. The game checks for winning patterns after every move.
3. If a player aligns three markers (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win.
4. If all boxes are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
5. Players can reset the game or start a new one anytime.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a score counter to track the number of wins for each player.
- Implement an AI mode to play against the computer.
- Add sound effects for a more engaging experience.
